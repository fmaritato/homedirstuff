Hadoop
 - What is the purpose of ...
   * name node?
     Controls filename -> blocksequence; block->machinelist
   * job tracker?
     Pushes work out to available task tracker nodes, keeping the work
     as close to the data as possible.
   * Rack awareness?
     The JT knows which nodes contain the data and which other machines
     are nearby. Reduce traffic to the main backbone network.
   * task tracker?
     Spawns new jvm to launch job. heartbeat to jt every few minutes.
   * combiners?
     Optimize/minimize the number of key/value pairs that will be shuffled
     across the network between mappers and reducers.
   * secondary name node?
     Regularly connects with the Primary Namenode and builds snapshots 
     of the Primary Namenode's directory information, which is then 
     saved to local/remote directories. These checkpointed images can
     be used to restart a failed Primary Namenode without having to
     replay the entire journal of filesystem actions, the edit log to
     create an up-to-date directory structure.
